# URL Shortener BE (WIP)
A simple rust web server built in Rust using Axum and SQLx. Follows DDD and some other clean architecture conventions I've picked up/observed.
Currently has JWT auth and Swagger Docs.
Will probably add tracing, testing and a FE (which will in a separate repo)
The point of this whole project was to learn Rust and TypeScript (FE)
