# URL Shortener BE (WIP)
A simple rust web server built in Rust using Axum and SQLx. Follows DDD and some other clean architecture conventions I've picked up/observed.
Currently has JWT auth and Swagger Docs.
Will probably add tracing, testing and a [FE](https://github.com/M-Faraz3110/url-shortener-fe) (which will be in a separate repo)
The point of this whole project was to learn Rust and get better with TypeScript (FE)
<s> Deployed this whole thing on [here](http://url-shortener-fe-445527450780.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com) for fun using AWS. Will probably add some new stuff soon as well. </s>
Took it down cuz it was costing me every month and i didnt really wanna pay that anymore :(
